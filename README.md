# Overview

`dwmbar` is a status bar for [dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org/) similar to [dwmblocks](https://github.com/torrinfail/dwmblocks). I wrote it in C++ just to troll the [suckless](https://suckless.org/sucks/) people. It has some built-in modules, but can also be extended with external scripts.

# Install

To install clone this repository and use `make` (no `cmake`, I am not a monster):

	cd dwmBar
	make
	sudo make install

This will put the `dwmbar` binary in `/usr/local/bin/`.
